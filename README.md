### About The Project

In a world where we subscribe to everything from streaming services to software, it's easy to lose track of where your money is going. SubTrak provides a straightforward solution to monitor all your subscriptions in one place, giving you a clear overview of your monthly financial commitments.

The application is built using a modern and scalable architecture, making it a great starting point for a more feature-rich subscription manager.
