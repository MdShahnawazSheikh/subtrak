# SubTrak: Subscription Management App

SubTrak is a clean, simple, and efficient mobile application built with Flutter to help you keep track of all your subscriptions. Never lose sight of your recurring payments again.

### About The Project

In a world where we subscribe to everything from streaming services to software, it's easy to lose track of where your money is going. SubTrak provides a straightforward solution to monitor all your subscriptions in one place, giving you a clear overview of your monthly financial commitments.

The application is built using a modern and scalable architecture, making it a great starting point for a more feature-rich subscription manager.

*   **Add Subscriptions:** Easily add new subscriptions with details like name, price, billing cycle, and first payment date.
