You are now acting as a STAFF-PLUS / PRINCIPAL ENGINEERING AGENT whose sole job is to BUILD AN INDUSTRY-LEADING PRODUCT, not an MVP.

This is NOT a roadmap.
This is NOT a plan.
This is a SINGLE, MAXIMAL, ALL-INSTRUCTION PROMPT to BUILD THE ENTIRE SUBTRAK APP with ADVANCED, DIFFERENTIATING, PREMIUM-GRADE FEATURES.

DO NOT simplify.
DO NOT trim scope.
DO NOT suggest “later”.
ASSUME unlimited local compute and senior-level engineering execution.

ABSOLUTE RULES
====================
- BUILD EVERYTHING
- NO PLANS, NO ROADMAPS, NO EXPLANATIONS

====================
CORE FEATURE SET (BASELINE)
====================
Include EVERYTHING from a world-class subscription manager PLUS the following ADVANCED SYSTEMS.

--------------------
1. SUBSCRIPTION INTELLIGENCE ENGINE
--------------------
Implement a full intelligence layer that provides:

- Cost-per-day, cost-per-use metrics
- Unused subscription detection (manual + inferred)
- Spend drift detection (price increases over time)
- Trial abuse detection
- Duplicate service detection
- Category-based spend analysis
- “Is this worth it?” scoring per subscription
- Predictive annual spend projection
- Smart alerts when monthly spend exceeds personal thresholds

All logic must be local, deterministic, explainable.

--------------------
2. ADVANCED RECURRENCE & BILLING
--------------------
Beyond basic recurrence, support:

- Variable billing cycles (e.g. every 28 days)
- Bi-monthly / quarterly / semi-annual
- One-time charges with reminders
- Usage-based subscriptions (manual input)
- Irregular renewals
- Price laddering (intro → standard → increased)
- Grace periods
- Failed payment tracking (manual)
- Currency-aware subscriptions
- Multi-timezone safety

--------------------
3. CALENDAR + TIMELINE SYSTEM
--------------------
Build a hybrid system:

- Calendar view (date-based)
- Timeline view (“what hits me next”)
- Monthly burn heatmap
- Yearly spend horizon
- Impact preview (“Next 7 / 30 / 90 days”)
- Visual stacking of same-day charges

All views must stay performant with large datasets.

--------------------
4. INPUT & AUTOMATION LAYER
--------------------
Implement ALL of the following:

- Manual add (fast path)
- Template-based add (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Screenshot ingestion pipeline (OCR hook, privacy-safe)
- Email receipt parsing hooks (local-only)
- Smart form autofill
- Subscription cloning
- Bulk edit & bulk pause
- Undo / rollback system

--------------------
5. NOTIFICATION & ALERT SYSTEM (ADVANCED)
--------------------
Beyond reminders, include:

- Multi-stage alerts (T-7, T-3, T-1)
- Silent notifications for background intelligence
- Critical alerts override
- Snooze logic
- Notification health monitoring
- Auto-reschedule on system reboot
- User-defined notification rules
- Per-subscription notification profiles

--------------------
6. INSIGHTS & DECISION SUPPORT
--------------------
Implement:

- Monthly financial summary cards
- “You could save ₹X by cancelling these”
- Regret detection (high cost, low usage)
- Behavioral nudges (ethical, no dark patterns)
- Visual spend narratives (not charts)
- Subscription aging indicators

--------------------
7. UX & INTERACTION EXCELLENCE
--------------------
Include:

- Gesture-first interactions
- One-hand usability everywhere
- Haptic feedback system
- Intelligent empty states
- Error-proof flows
- Ultra-smooth motion
- State-aware UI (paused, trial, overdue, failed)

No screen should feel static.

--------------------
8. POWER-USER FEATURES
--------------------
Implement:

- Tags & smart filters
- Saved views
- Rules engine (IF Netflix unused for 30 days → alert)
- Search with natural language queries
- Keyboard shortcuts (tablet / desktop)
- Batch operations

--------------------
9. DATA & SYSTEMS
--------------------
Implement:

- Hive with strict schema versioning
- Forward-compatible migrations
- Local encryption at rest (optional toggle)
- Backup / restore (local files)
- Deterministic data rebuild
- Crash-safe writes
- Audit log (local)

--------------------
10. MONETIZATION (ADVANCED)
--------------------
Implement:

- Feature gating at logic level
- Free / Pro / Lifetime tiers
- Graceful downgrade handling
- Pro-only intelligence layers
- No dark patterns
- No forced login
- Transparent value communication

--------------------
11. SETTINGS & CONTROL
--------------------
Implement:

- Full notification control

--------------------
12. QUALITY BAR
--------------------
The result MUST feel like:
- A CRED-level app

- A long-term scalable system

====================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
====================
- FULL FLUTTER PROJECT STRUCTURE
- EVERY FILE LISTED
- EVERY CLASS IMPLEMENTED
- EVERY FEATURE WIRED
- NO PLACEHOLDERS
- NO SIMPLIFICATIONS

If something is hard — SOLVE IT.
If something is ambiguous — DECIDE.
If something conflicts — PRIORITIZE UX & DATA INTEGRITY.

BUILD SUBTRAK AS IF IT WILL DEFINE THE CATEGORY.

Proceed.
